# Puggit

A simple tool for memorizing stuff. Currently a work in progress.

## Features

Current features:

- Create and delete sets
- Nothing more, really. The app isn't that useful yet ðŸ¤·

Roadmap:

- Practice sets with flash cards
- Test yourself with a writing mode
- Test yourself with a quiz mode
- Clean and minimalistic UI to help you focus
- Settings page with ability to change various aspects of the appearance
- Dark mode

## Technical details

Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). Currently not deployed anywhere, but you can clone the repo, install the required dependencies and run `npm run preview` and access the site on `https://localhost:3000.` Contributions are welcome, but you'll probably get stuck with my terrible code ðŸ¤ª

## Why "Puggit"?

The name "Puggit" stems from the norwegian term "Ã¥ pugge", which can be translated to "to memorize".
